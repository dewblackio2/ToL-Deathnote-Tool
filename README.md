7. The first step is to Press 'Open' in the bottom left, and open the image you want to draw
8. Once you open the image the display will look like this (with the image you selected):

11. Next adjust the Color Settings to suit your image, **Threshold is used to remove parts of the image that fall within a specified color range.** (Using Colors takes a lot longer to process due to the color comparission, if you just want to draw with black, dont enable any colors)

12. Once you set your desired settings, and want to process the image to see what it will look like when drawn, **press Apply** (When Apply is Pressed the Main GUI will not be able to recieve any commands until the processing phase is completed)

13. After the image finishes processing, you can either re-adjust/tweak the settings if you dont like what you see, **Once you change the settings again you need to hit Apply again to re-process the image with new settings!**

14. Now that we have our image ready to go, all you need to do is first, **check the Draw Image Size checkbox to display the border of the drawing to make sure it fits within the deathnote**

15. Next, Open microsoft paint, and **once you want to start the drawing process, Press F9**:

   ![image](https://i.gyazo.com/2608b630131686a2c3c356bdb4c0fbdd.png)

16. Once F9 is pressed, and the mouse follows the square pattern around the border, the position is locked and this window should appear:

17. **The pause key is VERY important! Since this program controls your mouse, use F8 to pause / resume the draw to regain control of your mouse while in game!** After Pressing OK on that window, you will see notifications like this appear in your bottom right hand corner of the screen:
   ```markdown
   **Press F7 To Skip Color**
   Please Select BLUE, and press F6 to continue!
   ```
18. During these "Splits" (I call them), the script will not draw the color listed, until you press F6 to continue.
19. Now just follow the steps in the notifications to finish the drawing and when you're done you can press Reset to draw a different image, or if you want the same one again just Press F9 again, or if you want the same Image with different settings, just change your settings, hit Apply, and once its done processing press F9 to draw :P
